Instructions for the 2nd laboratory exercise.

1. Design and build an HTML5 page that represents a Newspaper article.
    The article will have the Newspaper name with a logo (top-centered).

2. Demonstrate the following HTML5 semantic tags.
   a) <article>   b) <datetime> c) <section>  
   d) <hgroup>  e) <aside>  f) <footer> g) <nav>
   
3. The newspaper article will have atleast 3 sections, each section being 
   represented by a paragraph of text.
   
4. The article will have a <nav> tag that contains a set of hyperlinks for
   navigation within the page. See the attached pic.
   In the attached pic, the navigation bar is shown on top with the links - "Home",
   "About us" and "Contact us". In your article the navigation bar should be
   shown exactly as in the pic, but the link names can be different (relevant to 
   your article). Clicking on the links will take you to various parts within the
   page.
   
5. Atleast one section will have a <video> element.

6. Atleast one section will have an image.

7. Atleast one section will have a hyperlink. On clicking the hyperlink, a very brief
   summary (max 2 lines) appears on the right hand side of the page (The original page
   remains as is, but new content gets added on the right hand side).
   You should use the <aside> element for this. Remember that <aside> and all the
   elements listed in step(2) above, do not have any impact on page format because
   they are semantic tags.
   
   (hint)To achieve this functionality, place a piece of text beforehand in the page 
   (on the right hand side) and hide it using the "visibility" or "display" css property. 
   On clicking the hyperlink, you can change the css property to show the text. 
   You can hide the text again when the hyperlink is clicked a second time.

8. The page must have a footer. Use the <footer> element.

9. (hint).In order to achieve the functionality in step(4) above, you can create 
   an unordered list with three <li> elements. Each <li> element
   will inturn have an <a> element.Adjust the "padding" css property 
   for proper positioning. Also, by default, <li> elements are block elements
   which means they will be positioned one below another. So change the 
   "display" css property to "inline" so that the list elements come side-by-side.
   Also use the text-decoration property to remove underlines for the anchors.
   Adjust the background-color property to provide background color.
   
10. Atleast one section will have a cartoon. You need to draw this using the <canvas>
    element. The cartoon can be very simple.
